# Ruisseau de lune - Back-end

This is the back-end repository of my first group project with real clients.

# Project

They wanted to be able to modify their news and activities in an admin page, and to add images and videos.
We made a database modelisation following the Merise method. Then we made our CRUD organised in Methods, Controllers and Routes. We also followed basic security with environnement variables and hashing passwords.

# Tools

Our database is in MySQL and we used Node.js and Express for the development.
As usual Eslint and Prettier for the formatting.
